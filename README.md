## How do I get help with SimpleDraw?

If you are using SimpleDraw, and need help in any way, please join the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/UhTbjCVfYr).  You will be able to exchange messages with other users, and get input from the developer on issues you might be hitting.

You can also browse the issues in this repo, which may describe problems you are hitting, and may offer suggestions or workarounds for problems.

If you have a GitHub account, you can also raise issues (bugs or enhancements) in this repo, indicating changes that you would like to see.



## When should I use GitHub vs Discord?

[Discord](https://discord.gg/UhTbjCVfYr) is best for quick feedback, and direct interactions with other users and the developers.

GitHub is better for tracking overall status of bugs and new features, but please don't expect an immediate response to issues / comments on GitHub.  It may take me a week or so to respond to new issues raised on GitHub.
